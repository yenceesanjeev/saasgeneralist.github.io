Remote working is a conscious choice, both from the employer and the employee. That means, both parties are prepared and equipped to work remotely and manage remotely

What we're undergoing right now is a knee jerk reaction to the fact that we CANNOT work in an office. Very different from remote working. This is at best work-from-home at scale

Most managers right now are thrown into this situation and they've only managed teams in offices before. The same rules don't apply here.

It's completely fine to accept the fact that we need time to reorient. It's better than pretending to understand what remote working is. It's not just working from home, it's much more than that.
