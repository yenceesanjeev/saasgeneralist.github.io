Think like a purist, act like a realist

Purist - a person who insists on absolute adherence to traditional rules or structures
Realist - a person who accepts a situation as it is and is prepared to deal with it accordingly

Why think like a purist?
Structures, frameworks, philosophies and rulebooks exist for a reason. They're proven. They work. Others have succeeded with it. A purist mindset will ensure you that you believe in them whole heartedly

Why NOT to act like a purist?
You'll soon find that purist mindset is a rarity. Others don't really care. You'll soon be frustrated if you try to implement as is. You'll need to adapt & adopt to fit it contextually.

Why act like a realist?
If you don't account for reality, you won't be successful in any workplace. Constraints, politics, unnecessary processes are all a pain but real. Account for them when you want to get something done

Why NOT to think like a realist?
Considering real world constraints might slow you down. You might end up thinking "Anyways, I can't apply this. Why bother learning?". Yes, they exist but that shouldn't stop you from consuming proven philosophies and frameworks.
