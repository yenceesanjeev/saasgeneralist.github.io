I"ª<p>I havenâ€™t touched my resume in years. I went back to my old resume. Letâ€™s just say that â€œdisappointed with my younger selfâ€ is an understatement. Iâ€™ve spent a good chunk of my time in the last 4 years interviewing people and thatâ€™s taught me a lot about what interviewers look for.</p>

<p>Here are my top 7 tips for writing a resume.</p>

<h3 id="1-customize-your-resume-for-each-role">1. Customize your resume for each role!</h3>

<p>It might sound like a lot of work but worth it. Make sure your resume has the keywords right off the job description. For eg, if youâ€™re applying for a marketing role your resume SHOULD have lead generation, marketing campaigns, and social media.</p>

<p>Make sure you go through the job description fully to understand what theyâ€™re looking for. Itâ€™s an activity of almost putting yourself in the shoes of the hiring manager and reverse engineering what they would expect from you.</p>

<h3 id="2-use-specific-examples-avoid-generic-words">2. Use specific examples, avoid generic words</h3>

<p>Specific examples paint a clear picture, generic words paint a vague picture. Let me illustrate(pun intended) it with ane example. â€œIâ€™ve effectively improved the team moraleâ€ vs â€œMy team has the lowest attrition rate in the past 2 yearsâ€. Which one sounds a lot more convincing?</p>

<p>###</p>

<p>Avoid words like â€œefficiently improvedâ€, â€œeffectively increasedâ€. Instead, use words like â€œby x%â€, â€œsecond bestâ€</p>

<h3 id="3-your-resume-should-be-scannable-not-just-readable">3. Your resume should be scannable, not just readable</h3>

<p>If you havenâ€™t heard about the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/">F-shaped pattern of reading</a>, you should. We just consume so much content these days that it takes conscious effort to read something. Most of your resumes will be opened on a web browser and hiring managers will not read, they will scan.</p>

<p>###</p>

<p>So make your resume scannable. Include a lot of visual elements, leave a lot of white space in between texts and highlight key milestones. Avoid long sentences and paragraphs are an absolute no!</p>

<h3 id="4-dont-confuse-the-hiring-manager-theyll-reject-you">4. Donâ€™t confuse the hiring manager, theyâ€™ll reject you</h3>

<p>Try to put yourself in the shoes of the hiring manager, theyâ€™re looking at at least 5 to 10 resumes a day. Their mind has trained themselves to look for a certain pattern. For example, a marketing manager has trained themselves to look at years of relevant experience in a relevant field/domain. Once that criteria is hit, check.</p>

<p>Make sure you help them get to it quickly. While you might be tempted to include everything youâ€™ve done, donâ€™t. Include ONLY the things thatâ€™ll matter to the hiring manager</p>

<h3 id="5-dont-assume-knowledge-use-simple-words">5. Donâ€™t assume knowledge, use simple words</h3>

<p>Trust me, a resume is not where you want to tell the world that youâ€™re a walking thesaurus. Youâ€™ve probably spent a while in your current role and certain words/jargon are a part of you now. But think twice before including them in your resume. Are they common terminology or are they common only in your world?</p>

<p>When you include words/jargon that you understand but the hiring manager doesnâ€™t, theyâ€™re going to assume itâ€™s irrelevant. Use simple, everyday words to be safe. Sometimes, resumes are also screened before being passed on to the hiring manager so itâ€™s not always wise to assume that the reader is a domain expert.</p>

<h3 id="6-solid-proof-over-self-proclaimed-statements">6. Solid proof over self-proclaimed statements</h3>

<p>Itâ€™s obvious. No one wants to look bad on their resume so everyoneâ€™s going to say things like â€œHighly proficient with MS Excelâ€, â€œReader of emails, accepter of calendar invitesâ€ etc. The hiring managerâ€™s brain is already tuning them out.</p>

<p>Try to stand out of the crowd by including awards and accolades. â€œIndustry award winnerâ€ sounds much better than â€œDeep domain knowledgeâ€, doesnâ€™t it? These proof points instantly add credibility as itâ€™s not you blowing your own trumpet</p>

<h3 id="7-one-page-thats-all-people-have-time-for">7. One page, thatâ€™s all people have time for</h3>

<p>Itâ€™s been said a lot but one page, keep your resume to one page! While you explain how youâ€™ve had an extraordinary career and itâ€™s hard for you to keep it to one page, allow me to pull out the Marissa Mayerâ€™s <a href="https://enhancv.com/static/d1b75ac8b27c53faa5fc6540def8013c/6a7dd/marissa-mayer-resume.jpg">example</a></p>

<p>Your resume is not the only place for you to include everything. If you feel like youâ€™ve missed out on something that can help you with the job, feel free to include a cover letter as part of your job application.</p>

<p>Remember, the resume is not your full story, itâ€™s simply an entry ticket. Youâ€™re going to have plenty of chances to talk about your story later on. Resist the temptation to stuff your resume.</p>
