I"“<p>Building followers vs Gaining followers</p>

<p>Building Followers</p>
<ul>
  <li>Goal is to increase number of followers</li>
  <li>Every post should reach x number of likes, comments</li>
  <li>Projecting only the strong side because want to be perceived as a â€˜thought leaderâ€™</li>
  <li>Applying popular social media growth hacks to boost engagement</li>
  <li>Super focused on the voice, tone, content, grammar etc of the post</li>
</ul>

<p>Gaining Followers</p>
<ul>
  <li>Goal is to share valuable content</li>
  <li>Every post will not receive the same level of engagement but itâ€™s still important to share</li>
  <li>Not just shares content but also asks question, talks about vulnerabilities</li>
  <li>Just genuinely sharing content without worrying about time of day, strategies etc</li>
  <li>Posting just like how you would talk and acknowledging that there will be mistakes</li>
</ul>

<p>Donâ€™t look at social media (especially Linkedin) as an alternate version of yourself where you have to project a more â€œprofessionalâ€ version of yourself. Itâ€™s simply an extension of your offline self.</p>

<p>If you have valuable things to say to a colleague, theyâ€™re valuable here too. If you donâ€™t, then you probably wonâ€™t have anything valuable to say here.</p>

<p>Your goal here isnâ€™t to build followers, itâ€™s an outcome. Just keep saying valuable things youâ€™ll gain them soon enough.</p>
