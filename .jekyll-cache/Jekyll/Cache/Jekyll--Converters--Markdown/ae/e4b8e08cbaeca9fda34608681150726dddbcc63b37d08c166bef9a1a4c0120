I" <p>â€œWhoa, you have 200 slides?â€
â€œWhat? You only have 20 slides?â€</p>

<p>Both questions are equally worthless.</p>

<p>The quality of the presentation isnâ€™t directly proportional to the number of slides. Donâ€™t spend time in optimising the number of slides. Instead focus your time on:</p>

<p>1) Sketching the flow of your presentation
Your presentation should only have a single thread and few (only few) branches coming out of it. Spend time on building out this flow, outside your presentation app</p>

<p>2) Sourcing high quality images for your presentation
They might be photos from your phone, screenshots from a YouTube video, quality memes (my favorite) or even a hand drawn comic. Use that as an anchor while you speak</p>

<p>3) Choosing &amp; practicing key moments
Your presentation will have 2 or 3 key moments that the audience will take away. Donâ€™t let them decide what thatâ€™s going to be, you own it. How you set up the slides and practice the narration up to those moments matter. Make it theatrical, but not too much</p>

<p>200 slide presentations arenâ€™t boring
20 slide presentations arenâ€™t invaluable</p>

<p>As always, exceptions apply.</p>
