I"Ê<p>Think like a purist, act like a realist</p>

<p>Purist - a person who insists on absolute adherence to traditional rules or structures
Realist - a person who accepts a situation as it is and is prepared to deal with it accordingly</p>

<p>Why think like a purist?
Structures, frameworks, philosophies and rulebooks exist for a reason. Theyâ€™re proven. They work. Others have succeeded with it. A purist mindset will ensure you that you believe in them whole heartedly</p>

<p>Why NOT to act like a purist?
Youâ€™ll soon find that purist mindset is a rarity. Others donâ€™t really care. Youâ€™ll soon be frustrated if you try to implement as is. Youâ€™ll need to adapt &amp; adopt to fit it contextually.</p>

<p>Why act like a realist?
If you donâ€™t account for reality, you wonâ€™t be successful in any workplace. Constraints, politics, unnecessary processes are all a pain but real. Account for them when you want to get something done</p>

<p>Why NOT to think like a realist?
Considering real world constraints might slow you down. You might end up thinking â€œAnyways, I canâ€™t apply this. Why bother learning?â€. Yes, they exist but that shouldnâ€™t stop you from consuming proven philosophies and frameworks.</p>
