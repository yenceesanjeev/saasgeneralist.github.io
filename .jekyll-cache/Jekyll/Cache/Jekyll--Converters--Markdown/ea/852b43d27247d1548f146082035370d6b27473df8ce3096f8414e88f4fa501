I"ˆ<p>Donâ€™t waste time fighting the hypothesis war, quickly find ways to validate.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve all been through this. In a meeting, over an email, on a chat group. Thereâ€™s a new idea and thereâ€™s back and forth on why the idea will work/wonâ€™t work.</p>

<p>As the conversation progresses, we start bringing in imaginary variables
â€œThink about the motivation factorâ€
â€œThis is not even a top priority for the customerâ€</p>

<p>Sometimes the imagination gets out of hand
â€œThey donâ€™t even use smartphonesâ€</p>

<p>And muscles are being flexed
â€œIâ€™ve seen this so many times in my careerâ€</p>

<p>The truth is, no one can really know. So many things are being assumed. Usually, the loudest voices and the powerful chairs have their way.</p>

<p>Hypothesis wars will leave you exhausted, sometimes even disappointed. Spend your energy in finding inexpensive ways to validate your idea.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Run short, inexpensive experiments</li>
  <li>Ask your target audience</li>
  <li>Look for social proof on public forums</li>
</ul>

<p>Go back with proof.</p>

<p>Ideas seldom fall under a binary bucket of â€œWill workâ€/â€Wonâ€™t workâ€. Itâ€™s a function of many things like timing, execution quality and the target audience.</p>

<p>Of course,
There will be ideas that are so obvious/so stupid that need to be instantly implemented/rejected. Donâ€™t waste time experimenting there.</p>
