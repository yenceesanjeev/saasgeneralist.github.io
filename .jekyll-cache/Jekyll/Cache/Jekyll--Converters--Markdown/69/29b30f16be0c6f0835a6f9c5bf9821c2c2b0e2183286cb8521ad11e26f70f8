I"<p>This article is a rant, an outburst, a byproduct of my frustration towards the concept of phone calls. Mobile phones are a great invention. Mobile phones indicate a significant advancement in technology and itâ€™s only fair that we make use of it. Why are we still in a world that needs to â€˜talkâ€™ to each other to be able to talk to each other? Shouldnâ€™t phone calls be extinct?</p>

<p>I wish I can have a phone that I use only to text. I wish telecom providers start supplying â€œText onlyâ€ versions of their SIM cards. I wish the world understands introverts better. I wish mobile phones are built only with speakers and no microphones.</p>

<h2 id="to-no-one-in-particular">To no one in particularâ€¦</h2>

<p>It might break your heart when I say this but I actually donâ€™t pick up your calls intentionally. Donâ€™t take it personally, I donâ€™t pick up anyoneâ€™s call. Iâ€™ve missed pizza deliveries because I didnâ€™t want to pick up phone calls.</p>

<p>I do not understand why you have to use voice to communicate with me. Isnâ€™t my formatted, punctuated, perfectly written text message not good enough for you? Why do you need me to translate text into voice?</p>

<p>Donâ€™t get me wrong. Itâ€™s not that I donâ€™t want to talk to you (Who am I kidding, I DONâ€™T want to talk to you) but I donâ€™t like the fact that I have only a few seconds to process what you said, think about what Iâ€™m going to say, refine, filter, rephrase and actually say it. See how hard it is? I donâ€™t like that. I like to answer in my own time. If you give me space, I wonâ€™t take long.</p>

<p>A phone call completely disrupts me, it kills my flow. I spend a lot of time thinking and your phone call asks me to stop that. I can choose to ignore your call by turning on the Silent mode but yet you text me to pick up your phone call. Donâ€™t you get the point? Itâ€™s not a â€˜missedâ€™ call. Itâ€™s an â€˜I-Saw-It-But-Chose-Not-To-Pick-It-Upâ€™ call.</p>

<p>I can talk to you on the phone but there are rules. I need to be mentally prepared for the call. You need to tell me in advance so that I can prepare myself to spend the next few minutes â€˜talkingâ€™. Calling me out of the blue and expecting to have a conversation is NOT acceptable. I will ignore your call. I will not feel bad about it.</p>

<p><strong>When is it okay to call?</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>When youâ€™re physically not able to type/see â€” even then, voice notes might work</li>
</ol>

<p>2.A scheduled discussion â€” If Iâ€™ve agreed that we have something to discuss, we can set apart some time and discuss it.</p>

<p>3.When I suggest it â€” It is a rare occasion but if I feel that I need a call, Iâ€™ll make my move. You have to respect that move as itâ€™s incredibly hard for me. But if needed, I will call you.</p>

<p><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cd78de_4ebc5de50f6f41519d5dbeb003824aae~mv2.jpeg/v1/fill/w_360,h_451,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/cd78de_4ebc5de50f6f41519d5dbeb003824aae~mv2.webp" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>When is it ABSOLUTELY NOT okay to call?</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Asking for updatesâ€Šâ€”â€ŠIt is unacceptable to ask â€œHave you done it? What is this? Why is that?â€ questions over a phone call. Text me, Iâ€™ll clearly explain. Iâ€™ll include memes, comics, flowcharts, guidebooks if needed. I will not pick up the phone.</li>
</ol>

<p>2.To convey information â€” Sirusly? You just called to TELL me something? Isnâ€™t it easier for both of us if you had just texted? I just donâ€™t get â€” ARRGGH!</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>While weâ€™re texting â€” I choose to text for a reason. You cannot simply assume that Iâ€™ll be okay to continue the conversation over a phone call. No, Iâ€™m sorry, call someone else.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When Iâ€™ve just spoken to you 10 minutes back â€” Talking on the phone drains energy. In my head, Iâ€™m waiting to get off the call and go spend some alone time to regain it. Calling me â€˜backâ€™ will ABSOLUTELY ruin my day.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After asking me to call you â€” Iâ€™ve not called you. Read the signs. I do not want to talk.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>6.When Iâ€™ve just ignored your first call â€” Not picking up your call does not mean that Iâ€™ve not seen my phone. It means that I chose not to. Calling again will NOT help.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>To just â€˜randomlyâ€™ talk â€” I donâ€™t do that, sorry.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any other reason thatâ€™s not mentioned on the â€œWhenâ€™s it okay to call?â€ section â€” Actually, even if you have a reason thatâ€™s mentioned above, donâ€™t call me.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You have to understand that itâ€™s not you, itâ€™s me. I understand it doesnâ€™t make sense and I donâ€™t expect you to fully understand. I just want you to take my word for it when I say that I like/respect you but I donâ€™t want to talk to you on the phone.</p>

<p>P.S Let me meet you in the middle. Letâ€™s settle for voice notes.</p>

<p>P.P.S The above is absolutely fictional. Fun, isnâ€™t it?</p>
